New C++ game!

Task at DSV involving C++.


TODO:

Endresult:
Game with bouncing pokeball and movable pokemon, timer and "death".
    Optional improvements: endgame, startgame, leaderboard.

Current 18feb:
Isab: controllable Bulbasaur in game, and "player" subclass sprite.

Andreas: Finish breakout game loop into separate "GameEngine" class, Window and Game class.
GameEngine describes moving around and existence of objects in space which are included in game and not,
tells sprites to draw and where.
